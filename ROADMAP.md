# KISS Woo Coupon Debugger - Development Roadmap

This document outlines planned features and improvements for future versions of the KISS Woo Coupon Debugger plugin.

## Claude code fixes for non PSR4 v1.x series.

Looking at this WooCommerce coupon debugger plugin, I've identified 3 critical issues that should be addressed for security and performance:

## 1. ‚úÖ Unbounded Memory Usage and Potential DoS (Fixed)

Location: log_message() in kiss-coupon-debugger.php

- Implemented a hard cap at 1000 messages; new logs are dropped once the limit is reached
- Truncate message strings to 1000 characters
- Cap data payload size at ~10KB (fallback to small sentinel)

## 2. ‚úÖ Infinite Recursion in Object Sanitization (Fixed)

Location: sanitize_for_logging() function

- Reduced max traversal depth to 2
- Fixed circular reference detection by keeping visited objects in the stack (no unset)
- Added large array guard (returns a summary when count > 100)

## 3. **Inadequate AJAX Input Validation** (Medium-High)

**Location**: `handle_debug_coupon_ajax()` function

**Issue**: Minimal validation on user inputs that control plugin behavior:

```php
$coupon_code = isset( $_POST['coupon_code'] ) ? sanitize_text_field( wp_unslash( $_POST['coupon_code'] ) ) : '';
$product_id_selected = isset( $_POST['product_id'] ) ? absint( wp_unslash( $_POST['product_id'] ) ) : 0;
$user_id = isset( $_POST['user_id'] ) ? absint( wp_unslash( $_POST['user_id'] ) ) : 0;
```

**Problems**:
- No length limits on coupon code (could be used for resource exhaustion)
- No validation that user_id exists or is accessible to current user
- No rate limiting on debug requests
- Product ID validation happens later, allowing invalid IDs to enter processing

**Fix**:
```php
// Validate coupon code
$coupon_code = isset( $_POST['coupon_code'] ) ? sanitize_text_field( wp_unslash( $_POST['coupon_code'] ) ) : '';
if ( strlen( $coupon_code ) > 50 ) { // Reasonable coupon code limit
    wp_send_json_error( array( 'message' => __( 'Coupon code too long.', 'wc-sc-debugger' ) ) );
}

// Validate product ID exists if provided
$product_id_selected = isset( $_POST['product_id'] ) ? absint( wp_unslash( $_POST['product_id'] ) ) : 0;
if ( $product_id_selected > 0 && ! wc_get_product( $product_id_selected ) ) {
    wp_send_json_error( array( 'message' => __( 'Invalid product ID.', 'wc-sc-debugger' ) ) );
}

// Validate user ID exists if provided  
$user_id = isset( $_POST['user_id'] ) ? absint( wp_unslash( $_POST['user_id'] ) ) : 0;
if ( $user_id > 0 && ! get_user_by( 'id', $user_id ) ) {
    wp_send_json_error( array( 'message' => __( 'Invalid user ID.', 'wc-sc-debugger' ) ) );
}

// Add simple rate limiting
$rate_limit_key = 'wc_sc_debug_' . get_current_user_id();
$recent_requests = get_transient( $rate_limit_key );
if ( $recent_requests && $recent_requests > 10 ) { // 10 requests per minute
    wp_send_json_error( array( 'message' => __( 'Too many debug requests. Please wait.', 'wc-sc-debugger' ) ) );
}
set_transient( $rate_limit_key, ( $recent_requests ?: 0 ) + 1, 60 );
```

## Summary

While this plugin operates in a trusted admin environment, these issues could still cause:
- **Server crashes** from memory exhaustion
- **Performance degradation** from infinite loops
- **Resource abuse** from malicious or accidental overuse

The fixes focus on adding proper bounds checking, preventing infinite recursion, and validating inputs before processing.
